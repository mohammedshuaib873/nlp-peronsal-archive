Now that we have a proper NLTK chunker, we can use it to extract chunks. 
Hereâ€™s a simple example that tags a sentence, chunks the tagged sentence, 
then prints out each noun phrase.

# sentence should be a list of words
tagged = tagger.tag(sentence)
tree = chunker.parse(tagged)
# for each noun phrase sub tree in the parse tree
for subtree in tree.subtrees(filter=lambda t: t.node == 'NP'):
    # print the noun phrase as a list of part-of-speech tagged words
    print subtree.leaves()
